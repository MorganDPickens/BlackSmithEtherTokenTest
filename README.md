# BlackSmithEtherTokenTest

Today, I am excited to announce the creation of a test token for Blacksmith Ether. This token was meticulously crafted using the Sepolia testnet, ensuring a robust and secure development environment. Leveraging the power of an Infura API key, the deployment was seamlessly executed using Foundry, a reliable and efficient tool for such tasks. Glad to create the first test token for BSE and this was a great wayh to practice mint
