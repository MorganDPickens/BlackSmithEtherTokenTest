# BlackSmithEtherTokenTest

Today, I am excited to announce the creation of a test token for Blacksmith Ether. This token was made in order to test a liqduity ocean. This token was made using the Sepolia testnet. Leveraging the power of an Infura API key, the deployment was seamlessly executed using Foundry, a reliable and efficient tool for such tasks. Glad to create the first test token for BSE and this was a great way to practice minting a token using foundry.
